# blog-tagfilter
This menutype for a blog shows items in an isotope with the possibility to filter by tag. 
(Bootstrap 4)
If your tags are nested they are grouped by their parent tag.

You can enable also filtering by custom field. Then the values coming from the custom fields have to be comma-seperated values.

I am doing that for fun and to support the community. However, if you feel like I should have more time for fun things you can support me by "donating" something. I will send you an invoice if needed. https://www.paypal.me/coolcatcreations/

Todos:
- Adding a custom message if nothing is found
- (Maybe) giving the possibility to define the hover color of the buttons
- Translate some missing strings
- having an own tab for Filter Settings
- Showing Label instead of Alias for the heading
- Order of the filters (?) ...
- Optimize Classes for CSS frameworks beside BS4
