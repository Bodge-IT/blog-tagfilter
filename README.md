# blog-tagfilter
This menutype for a blog shows items in an isotope with the possibility to filter by tag. 
(Bootstrap 4)
If your tags are nested they are grouped by their parent tag.

You can enable also filtering by custom field. Then the values coming from the custom fields have to be comma-seperated values.

I am doing that for fun and to support the community. However, if you feel like I should have more time for fun things you can support me by "donating" something. I will send you an invoice if needed. https://www.paypal.me/coolcatcreations/
